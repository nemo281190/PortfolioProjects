# Covid_PortfolioProject

This is a small project on Covid infections/deaths for different countries.

* I have used the Covid data online  from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths for tze timeframe 2020 to April 2021.
* I have done some calculation for total cases, total deaths, Percentage of Population infected and death count by location in SQL.
* The same calculation has been used to create visulization in Power BI and aslo used some DAX expressions in Power BI.
